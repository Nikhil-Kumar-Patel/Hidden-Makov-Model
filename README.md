# Hidden-Makov-Model

In this project, we attempt to validate the potential of the HMM in stock price forecasting and provide an extensive analysis of the effectiveness of the HMM compared to the traditional Historical Average Return (HAR) approach.
We also aim to explore the theoretical foundations of Markov models, with a specific focus on hidden Markov models by delving into the underlying principles and mathematical frameworks of HMMs.
