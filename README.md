# Hidden-Makov-Model

In this project, we implemented the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for stock price forecasting, demonstrating its potential
as a predictive tool in financial markets.
Conducted an extensive comparative analysis between HMM and the traditional Historical Average Return (HAR)
approach, evaluating their effectiveness in stock price forecasting and providing empirical evidence to support the
superiority of HMM.
Explored the theoretical foundations of Markov models, with a specific focus on Hidden Markov Models, studying
the underlying principles and mathematical frameworks to gain a deeper understanding of their application in
financial forecasting.
